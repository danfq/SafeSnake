## What is it?

SafeSnake aims to provide a safe haven for those who struggle with finding the right words for what they are feeling.

So, to that end, SafeSnake gives the User a selection of pre-written phrases, which may be used to get their point / feelings across.

## Where can I get it?

As of right now, SafeSnake is available on the [App Store]("https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/safesnake/id6477356156").
I am in the process of making it available on the Play Store as well.
